<h4>ABSTRACT<h4><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The homepages of websites are intended to direct users to information provided throughout the website and, therefore, should be organized in a way that allows the retrieval of information. This study considers the relationship between the Information Organization in Library Science and Information Architecture for the Web, addressing theoretical aspects of both areas. The universities are the subject of this study because they are institutions of education, research, and extension and have a wide target audience. The general goal is to investigate the relationship between the type of information available on website homepages of Brazilian universities and how it is organized. The specific goals are a) check the visibility given to each type of information through the area used on the homepages of websites of the universities selected b) identify the view of each university selected of their websites, and c) relate types of information available and types of organization on website homepages of the universities selected. The top ten universities in Brazil, namely: USP, Unicamp, UFSC, UFRJ, UFMG, UFRGS, PUC-Rio, UFF, UFRN, and UFPR were chosen from the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities as objects of this study. The indicators used comprise indicators of organization schemes, specifically: Alphabetical, Chronological, Geographic, Subject, Task, Audience, Metaphor, and Hybrid, and indicators of the type of information, related in four groups: Pedagogic and research, Information and communication, Administrative and institutional, and Utilities and search. The definition of parameters for screen capture used statistics of websites, that is in the operating system Microsoft Windows XP, Mozilla Firefox 3.x and screen resolution 1024 x 768; it was also used both Printscreen key on a standard keyboard for Windows and the extension for Firefox Screengrab!. Areas to be observed were identified by different colors and, in addition to the indicators mentioned, include visual elements of the operation system and browser and unused space and filler. Two images of each university: the browser window in full, including operation system elements, and the complete homepage were captured. And questions were sent to the universities selected seeking their opinion about their own website. A brief geographic overview, history, and characterization of each selected university are presented, showing that six are from Southeastern region, three from Southern and one from Northeastern. Among those, one is private and among the nine public universities, two are state and seven are federal. The results of the first specific objective show that the average area occupied by the group Pedagogic and research is 6.3%, Information and communication, 20.8%, Administrative and institutional, 26.8% (especially the variation of 40%), Utilities and search, 2.3%, Operation system and browser, 25.7%, and Unused space and filler, 18.1%. The average percentage of the entire homepage viewed without scrolling the screen is 46.1%. Regarding the second specific goal, there is a balance between department and training of those who update the website, being the majority from Communication area and not Library Science. It was also noted that the goals mentioned by the universities are included in the groupings proposed and that the relationship between these goals and the displayed area is consistent in four out of six universities, there are small differences in one of the universities, and another did not have clearly defined goals. The third goal, which culminates in the general goal, resulted in the observation of two patterns in the relationship between the types of information and how they are organized: the first factor favors the organization by Subject and each university uses from one to three schemes at the same time - the grouping pattern observed for Pedagogic and research and Administrative and institutional, the second pattern does not favor any specific organization and universities use from two to four schemes - the clusters observed for Information and communication and Utilities and search.</p><br />
